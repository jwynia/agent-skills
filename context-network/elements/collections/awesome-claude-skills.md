## Curation Notes

**Runtime Consideration**: Many skills in this collection may include Python scripts. Per `decisions/deno-runtime-requirement.md`, any scripts must be converted to Deno/TypeScript before importing into local `/skills/`.

**Structure**: Collection uses flat structure at top level. When curating, adapt to local nested structure (`skills/[domain]/[category]/[skill-name]/`).
