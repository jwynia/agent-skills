# Spoken Adaptation Guide

## Principle: Sound Natural When Read Aloud

The test for spoken adaptation: read the text aloud. Does it flow? Do you stumble? Would a listener understand on first hearing?

## When to Adapt

Adapt text when:
- Parenthetical asides break the flow
- Sentences are too long or nested
- Abbreviations would sound awkward spoken
- Punctuation creates unnatural pauses
- Academic hedging obscures the point

Do NOT adapt when:
- The author's voice would be lost
- Rhetorical devices are intentional
- The original phrasing is memorable
- Simplification would change meaning

## Adaptation Categories

### 1. Structural Simplification

**Written:** "The tool — which, it should be noted, was available to both participants — produced dramatically different results."

**Spoken:** "The tool was available to both participants. But it produced dramatically different results."

### 2. Parenthetical Handling

**Written:** "They found the floor (where anyone can get results) but never discovered the ceiling."

**Spoken Options:**
- "They found the floor — where anyone can get results — but never discovered the ceiling."
- "They found the floor, where anyone can get results. But they never discovered the ceiling."

### 3. Academic Hedging

**Written:** "It could be argued that the distinction between..."

**Spoken (if author's voice permits):** "The distinction between..."

**Written:** "Research suggests that..."

**Spoken:** "Research shows that..." (if the research is definitive)

### 4. List Handling

**Written:** "The elements include: clarity, brevity, and impact."

**Spoken:** "The elements include clarity, brevity, and impact."

For longer lists:
**Written:** "1. First item 2. Second item 3. Third item"

**Spoken:** "First: [item]. Second: [item]. And third: [item]."

### 5. Abbreviation Expansion

| Written | Spoken |
|---------|--------|
| e.g. | for example |
| i.e. | that is |
| etc. | and so on |
| vs. | versus |
| w/ | with |

### 6. Emphasis Preservation

Italics in writing often indicate emphasis, but TTS needs context cues.

**Written:** "The microwave *doesn't have* a 'more skill' setting."

**Spoken:** "The microwave doesn't have a 'more skill' setting." (Natural stress from sentence structure)

If emphasis is critical and might be lost:
**Spoken:** "The microwave... it simply doesn't have a 'more skill' setting."

## What NOT to Change

- Author's distinctive phrasing
- Rhetorical questions (these work great in audio)
- Parallel structure ("Some... others...")
- Deliberate fragment sentences
- Characteristic word choices
- The argument's logic or claims

## Scene Transition Language

When a section break becomes a scene break, sometimes you need to add spoken transitions:

| Context | Transition Type | Example |
|---------|-----------------|---------|
| New major section | Introduction | "Now..." or "Here's where..." |
| Returning to main thread | Callback | "Back to our question:" |
| Contrast or pivot | Pivot | "But here's the thing:" |
| Building on previous | Connection | "And this connects to..." |
| Conclusion | Summary | "So what does this mean?" |

**Use sparingly.** Only add transitions when the audio would feel jarring without them.

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing adapted text:

- [ ] Read it aloud - does it flow naturally?
- [ ] Check for tongue-twisters or awkward consonant clusters
- [ ] Verify the author's voice is preserved
- [ ] Confirm no meaning was changed
- [ ] Ensure transitions feel organic, not mechanical
- [ ] Verify abbreviations are expanded
- [ ] Check sentence length (aim for 15-25 words average)
