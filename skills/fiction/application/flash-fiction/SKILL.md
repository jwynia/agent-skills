# Flash Fiction Diagnostic

type: diagnostic
mode: evaluative
triggers:
  - "flash fiction feels weak"
  - "story under 1500 words"
  - "micro fiction"
  - "sudden fiction"
  - "short short story"
  - "compressed narrative"

## Purpose

Diagnose and fix problems in flash fiction and micro fiction (typically under 1500 words). Flash fiction demands exceptional craft efficiency—every word must serve multiple purposes. This skill identifies which dimension needs attention when a piece isn't working.

## Quick Reference

| State | Signal | Core Issue |
|-------|--------|------------|
| FF1 | Opening doesn't hook | Structure/Pacing problem |
| FF2 | Characters feel thin | Character compression failure |
| FF3 | Beginning/ending disconnect | Frame weakness |
| FF4 | Everything on surface | Subtext missing |
| FF5 | Prose feels flat | Imagery/figurative language weak |
| FF6 | Setting generic | Sensory detail lacking |
| FF7 | Theme absent or preachy | Thematic development off |
| FF8 | Words don't sing | Language precision/rhythm issues |
| FF9 | Something feels "off" | Logical consistency breach |

## Diagnostic States

### FF1: Structure & Pacing Failure

**Symptoms:**
- Opening doesn't grab
- Middle sags or rushes
- Ending feels abrupt or dragged
- Word count not distributed well
- Arc feels incomplete

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. Does the first sentence create immediate engagement?
2. Is there a clear turning point?
3. Does each paragraph advance multiple purposes (plot + character + theme)?
4. Is the scope appropriate for the word count?
5. Is information released at optimal moments?

**Interventions:**
- Map the arc: beginning → rising action → climax → resolution
- Calculate word distribution across sections
- Strengthen opening hook (in medias res, mystery, declaration)
- Ensure ending provides closure while leaving resonance
- Cut any paragraph that only does one thing

**Transformation Pattern:**
```
WEAK: "Sarah had been working at the firm for three years when she found the file."
STRONG: "The file had no label—just a smudge of what looked like dried blood along its edge."
```

---

### FF2: Character Compression Failure

**Symptoms:**
- Characters feel generic or interchangeable
- Too much backstory exposition
- Character change feels unearned
- Relationships explained rather than shown
- No sense of life beyond the page

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. Is each character introduced through revealing action?
2. Can history be inferred without explicit backstory?
3. Do defining objects/mannerisms reveal essence?
4. Is the character arc shown through parallel actions?
5. Do relationships emerge through interaction, not explanation?

**Interventions:**
- Replace generic description with character-specific detail
- Convert backstory exposition to implications
- Ensure first action reveals personality
- Show change through decision pattern shifts
- Establish relationships through what's unspoken

**Transformation Pattern:**
```
WEAK: "James had PTSD from the war. He moved to escape memories."
STRONG: "James flinched at the turkey platter's clatter, hand reaching for the phantom sidearm.
He'd chosen this town for its population sign: 827 souls—small enough to hear rumors
of strangers before meeting them."
```

---

### FF3: Beginning/Ending Frame Weakness

**Symptoms:**
- Opening and closing feel disconnected
- No sense of journey despite brevity
- Ending doesn't fulfill opening's promise
- First/last images don't resonate
- Structure feels arbitrary

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. What does the opening promise the reader?
2. Does the ending fulfill or meaningfully subvert that promise?
3. Is there a first/last image relationship (echo, transformation, contrast)?
4. Does the ending feel both surprising and inevitable?
5. What emotion persists after reading?

**Interventions:**
- Identify the implicit contract the opening creates
- Ensure closing image relates to opening image
- Consider circular structure (return with transformation)
- Strengthen final sentence for resonance
- Check that emotional journey is complete

**Transformation Pattern:**
```
WEAK ENDING: "So they decided not to sell. They were happy. The end."
STRONG ENDING: "Daniel returned the FOR SALE sign to the garage, laid it beside the smaller
one from his childhood treehouse. Some prices, they'd decided, were too steep to calculate."
```

---

### FF4: Subtext Missing

**Symptoms:**
- Everything stated explicitly
- No layers beneath surface
- Readers don't participate in meaning-making
- Backstory dumped, not implied
- No iceberg effect

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. What is stated that could be implied?
2. What is strategically left unsaid?
3. Are there meaningful gaps for readers to fill?
4. Does the visible portion suggest invisible depth?
5. Is ambiguity purposeful or accidental?

**Interventions:**
- Convert explicit statements to implications
- Create strategic gaps (narrative ellipsis)
- Withhold information for revelation impact
- Apply iceberg theory: show tip, imply mass below
- Ensure backstory emerges through objects/actions, not explanation

**Transformation Pattern:**
```
EXPLICIT: "John never recovered from his divorce. He felt bitter about Maria leaving him."
IMPLIED: "John twisted his wedding ring finger, a reflex unchanged by three years and
the absence of metal. The man at the next table laughed, and John recognized
the laugh before the face."
```

### FF5: Imagery & Figurative Language Weak

**Symptoms:**
- Prose feels flat or utilitarian
- Metaphors cliched or absent
- No pattern to imagery
- Symbols heavy-handed or missing
- Descriptions don't resonate

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. Are comparisons fresh and precise?
2. Do metaphors/similes serve multiple purposes (character + theme + emotion)?
3. Is there an imagery pattern that develops?
4. Are symbolic objects naturally integrated?
5. Is there balance between concrete and abstract?

**Interventions:**
- Replace clichéd comparisons with original ones
- Ensure figurative language reveals character perspective
- Build related image patterns that develop
- Select symbolic objects that can transform meaning
- Ground abstract concepts in concrete imagery

**Transformation Pattern:**
```
FLAT: "The factory was abandoned and looked sad."
RICH: "Machinery hulked under dust shrouds, metal teeth gleaming in fractured light
between boarded windows. No one suggested splitting up."
```

---

### FF6: Setting & Sensory Detail Lacking

**Symptoms:**
- Location generic or absent
- Only visual sense engaged
- Setting doesn't serve character/theme
- Atmosphere missing
- Environment feels like backdrop, not participant

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. How quickly is the reader oriented in specific time/place?
2. Are multiple senses engaged?
3. Does setting reveal character without stating it?
4. Does environment reinforce theme?
5. Is atmospheric mood established through concrete detail?

**Interventions:**
- Replace generic settings with specific, revealing locations
- Incorporate non-visual senses (sound, smell, touch, taste)
- Make setting details reveal character relationship to place
- Align physical environment with thematic concerns
- Embed mood in concrete details, not stated atmosphere

**Transformation Pattern:**
```
GENERIC: "The coffee shop was busy. People sat drinking coffee."
SPECIFIC: "The Fallout Shelter Café's concrete walls trapped steam from twenty
underemployed grad students' laptops, their whispered theories competing
with grinding beans and Ella Fitzgerald's crackled vinyl."
```

---

### FF7: Thematic Development Off

**Symptoms:**
- Theme absent or unclear
- Theme stated, not embodied
- Didactic/preachy tone
- Single perspective dominates
- Ending oversimplifies

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. Is the theme identifiable without being heavy-handed?
2. Does theme emerge from character and situation (not imposed)?
3. Are multiple perspectives on the theme represented?
4. Is thematic content conveyed through concrete details?
5. Does the conclusion deepen rather than simplify?

**Interventions:**
- Embody theme in action and object, not statement
- Show theme through specific circumstances, then let readers generalize
- Include multiple viewpoints on the thematic question
- Replace "character realized that..." with demonstrating action
- Preserve complexity in the conclusion

**Transformation Pattern:**
```
STATED: "Carl realized that trust was essential for relationships."
EMBODIED: "Carl handed her the combination to the safe where he kept
his mother's letters, then turned away so he wouldn't see her expression."
```

---

### FF8: Language Precision & Rhythm Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Weak verbs (walked, went, was)
- Vague nouns (thing, stuff, area)
- Unnecessary modifiers
- Sentence monotony
- No musicality

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. Does each verb precisely capture the specific action?
2. Are nouns concrete and specific?
3. Does each modifier meaningfully sharpen understanding?
4. Are sentence lengths and structures varied?
5. Do sound patterns enhance (alliteration, rhythm, cadence)?

**Interventions:**
- Replace weak verbs with precise, energetic alternatives
- Substitute general nouns with specific, sensory-rich ones
- Eliminate redundant or decorative modifiers
- Vary sentence structure for rhythm and emphasis
- Develop sound patterns that match meaning

**Transformation Pattern:**
```
WEAK: "She went across the field quickly."
PRECISE: "She slashed through the wheat, scattering husks."

MONOTONOUS: "He opened the door. He looked inside. He saw nothing. He closed the door."
VARIED: "He opened the door and looked inside. Nothing. The door clicked shut as he turned."
```

---

### FF9: Logical Consistency Breach

**Symptoms:**
- Something feels "off" even if hard to identify
- Physical impossibilities
- Timeline contradictions
- Characters know things they shouldn't
- Rules established then broken

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. Do objects function consistently?
2. Does the timeline allow events as described?
3. Do characters know only what they could realistically know?
4. Are physical limitations respected?
5. If rules are bent, is it consistent?

**Interventions:**
- Map physical movement and verify possibility
- Chart events chronologically with durations
- Check character knowledge boundaries
- Verify cause-effect proportionality
- Document world rules and check consistent application

**Transformation Pattern:**
```
IMPOSSIBLE: "She finished her shift at midnight, drove 30 miles home,
cooked dinner, and was in bed by 12:15."
POSSIBLE: "She finished at midnight. The apartment she'd rented
closer to the hospital meant she could be cooking within minutes."
```

## Anti-Patterns

### The Miniature Novel
Trying to compress a novel-length story into flash length. Flash fiction is not a summary—it's a complete experience in miniature. Choose a scope that fits.

### The Twist Dependency
Relying entirely on a surprise ending. If the story only works with the twist, the preceding content isn't pulling weight. The journey should matter.

### The Vignette Trap
Beautiful prose without narrative movement. Flash fiction still needs change—something must be different by the end, even if subtle.

## Integration Points

**Inbound:**
- From `story-sense`: After identifying story state
- From `drafting`: During first draft creation
- From `revision`: For line-level polish

**Outbound:**
- To `prose-style`: For deeper language work
- To `dialogue`: For conversation problems
- To `endings`: For closure issues

**Complementary:**
- `scene-sequencing`: Single-scene pacing
- `character-arc`: Compressed transformation
- `cliche-transcendence`: Fresh imagery generation

## Word Count Guidance

| Length | Name | Focus Priority |
|--------|------|----------------|
| <100 | Drabble | Single image, single moment, maximum compression |
| 100-500 | Micro fiction | One scene, one shift, implication over statement |
| 500-1000 | Flash fiction | Small arc, 1-2 scenes, full iceberg effect |
| 1000-1500 | Sudden fiction | Multiple scenes possible, more character room |
| 1500-2500 | Short short | Approaching short story territory |
