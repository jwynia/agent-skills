# Pass Criteria Reference

Detailed evaluation criteria extracted from editorial skills. Use this reference when evaluating scenes.

---

## Pass 1: Scene-Sequencing (35% weight)

**Source:** `skills/fiction/scene-sequencing/SKILL.md`

### Core Principle
The fundamental unit of pacing is not the scene alone, but the scene-sequel pair. Scenes create tension; sequels process it.

### Scene Structure: Goal → Conflict → Disaster

#### Goal Evaluation
- [ ] Goal is specific and concrete
- [ ] Goal is achievable within the scene
- [ ] Goal connects to larger story goals
- [ ] Goal is clear to reader within first beats

**PASS:** Clear goal in opening beats
**WARN:** Goal exists but buried
**FAIL:** No discernible character goal

#### Conflict Evaluation
- [ ] Opposition to goal present
- [ ] Conflict escalates (not static)
- [ ] Each beat makes goal harder
- [ ] Source of conflict appropriate (character, environment, internal)

**PASS:** Opposition intensifies through scene
**WARN:** Conflict present but static
**FAIL:** No real opposition

#### Disaster Evaluation
- [ ] Scene ends with clear outcome
- [ ] Outcome creates complications

| Outcome Type | Strength |
|-------------|----------|
| Yes, but... | Strongest (goal achieved, new problem) |
| No, and furthermore... | Strong (goal failed, situation worse) |
| No | Moderate (goal failed, must retry) |
| Yes | Weak (kills tension) |

**PASS:** "Yes, but..." or "No, and furthermore..."
**WARN:** Simple "No"
**FAIL:** Clean "Yes" or no resolution

### Sequel Structure: Reaction → Dilemma → Decision

#### Sequel Evaluation
- [ ] Emotional reaction present
- [ ] Character faces choice with no good options
- [ ] Decision leads to next scene's goal

**PASS:** Full sequel present (or appropriate compression)
**WARN:** Abbreviated sequel
**FAIL:** Missing after high-tension scene

### Pacing Ratio
- [ ] Scene/sequel ratio matches intended pacing
- [ ] More scene = fast-paced, action-heavy
- [ ] More sequel = slow-paced, reflective

**PASS:** Matches intent
**WARN:** Slight mismatch
**FAIL:** Severely mismatched

### Anti-Patterns to Flag
- The Relentless Scene (no processing time)
- The Wallowing Sequel (introspection without decision)
- The Arbitrary Disaster (outcome disconnected from conflict)
- The Clean Victory (drains tension)
- Missing Goal (no drive)

## Pass 2: Character-Arc (25% weight)

**Source:** `skills/fiction/character-arc/SKILL.md`

### Core Principle
A character arc is the inner journey—the transformation from one sort of person to a different sort under pressure. The arc is not the plot.

### Arc Components

#### Lie Evaluation
- [ ] Character's false belief is evident
- [ ] Lie manifests in choices/behavior
- [ ] Lie connects to backstory wound

**PASS:** False belief evident in choices
**WARN:** Lie present but unstated
**FAIL:** No lie operative in this scene

#### Want/Need Gap
- [ ] What character thinks they need (Want) is clear
- [ ] What would actually fulfill them (Need) is different
- [ ] Gap creates tension

**PASS:** Clear tension between stated and actual need
**WARN:** Gap exists but unclear
**FAIL:** Want = Need (no tension)

#### Arc Progress
- [ ] Scene advances character toward or away from truth
- [ ] Or scene challenges the arc meaningfully

**PASS:** Scene advances or challenges arc
**WARN:** Arc static but consistent
**FAIL:** Character contradicts established arc

#### Transformation Markers
- [ ] If this is a transformation beat, it's earned
- [ ] Character's choices reflect current arc position
- [ ] Resistance to change is visible when appropriate

**PASS:** Choices reflect arc position
**WARN:** Position unclear
**FAIL:** Acts against established personality

### Anti-Patterns to Flag
- The Informed Arc (told changed, not shown)
- The Magic Mentor (change from telling, not discovery)
- The Trauma = Transformation Fallacy
- The Perfect Protagonist (no lie = no arc)
- The Instant Epiphany (no buildup)

## Pass 3: Cliche-Transcendence (15% weight)

**Source:** `skills/fiction/cliche-transcendence/SKILL.md`

### Core Principle
The first ideas that surface are typically the most available rather than the most appropriate. A trope becomes cliché when every aspect matches the default pattern.

### The Four Axes Evaluation

| Axis | Cliché | Orthogonal |
|------|--------|------------|
| Form | Expected element | Same but with twist |
| Knowledge | Knows about central plot | Has own concerns, intersects accidentally |
| Goal | Wants to help/stop protagonist | Wants something unrelated that collides |
| Role | Exists for protagonist | Has own story that intersects |

#### Orthogonality Test
For each significant element in the scene:
- [ ] Form axis: Is it the expected version?
- [ ] Knowledge axis: Does it know what story it's in?
- [ ] Goal axis: Does it exist to serve the protagonist?
- [ ] Role axis: Does it have its own story?

**PASS:** At least 2 axes orthogonal
**WARN:** Only 1 axis orthogonal
**FAIL:** All axes match default (pure cliché)

### Key Question
**"Does it know what story it's in?"**
- Cliché: Elements act as if they know their narrative function
- Fresh: Elements have own logic that collides with story

### Anti-Patterns to Flag
- Inversion as Innovation (opposite equally tired)
- Novelty Over Function (original but doesn't serve story)
- Enumeration Avoidance (didn't identify the defaults)
- Form-Only Changes (corporate security = FBI in different uniform)
- Protagonist Orbit Preservation (everything serves hero)

## Pass 4: Dialogue (15% weight)

**Source:** `skills/fiction/dialogue/SKILL.md`

### Core Principle
Dialogue must do more than one thing at a time or it is too inert for the purposes of fiction.

### The Three Layers

| Layer | Definition | Check |
|-------|------------|-------|
| Text | What's literally said | Character-specific? Natural rhythm? |
| Subtext | What's meant beneath | Gap between said and meant? |
| Context | What shapes exchange | Power dynamics? History? |

### Voice Distinctiveness (D1)
- [ ] Characters distinguishable without tags
- [ ] Vocabulary differs per character
- [ ] Sentence complexity varies
- [ ] Directness levels differ

- [ ] Contractions used appropriately
- [ ] Some incomplete sentences
- [ ] Characters interrupt/talk past each other

### Exposition Handling (D3)
- [ ] No "As you know, Bob..." constructions
- [ ] Information through conflict/discovery
- [ ] Characters disagree about facts

**PASS:** Information through conflict
**WARN:** Minor "as you know"
**FAIL:** Exposition dump

### Subtext Presence (D4)
- [ ] Emotional states shown, not declared
- [ ] Characters want things they can't ask directly
- [ ] Gap between said and meant

**PASS:** Clear subtext layer
**WARN:** Occasional direct statements
**FAIL:** Everything on-the-nose

### Double-Duty Test (D5)
For each exchange, count functions served:
1. Plot advancement
2. Character revelation
3. Subtext/tension
4. Relationship development

**PASS:** 3+ functions
**WARN:** 2 functions
**FAIL:** Single function only

### Anti-Patterns to Flag
- The Exposition Dump
- The Identical Twins (same voice)
- The Court Reporter (meaningless realism)
- The Emotional Narrator (tags do dialogue's job)
- The Tennis Match (perfect alternation)

## Pass 5: Prose-Style (10% weight)

**Source:** `skills/fiction/prose-style/SKILL.md`

### Core Principle
Style is not decoration; style is content. Vigorous writing is concise.

### Sentence Variety (P4)
- [ ] Sentence lengths vary (short, medium, long)
