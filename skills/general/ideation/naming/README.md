# Naming Skills

Skills for creating names that work across brands, products, characters, places, and titles.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| [naming](SKILL.md) | Diagnose naming problems and guide creation of names that work |

## Related Framework

The naming skill is derived from `frameworks/naming/naming-framework.md`, which provides the complete four-layer model (Sound, Meaning, Cultural, Functional) and the Professional Naming Process (Sequential) for brand/product naming.

## Integration Points

| Skill | Connection |
|-------|------------|
| **conlang** | Phoneme inventories for consistent fictional naming systems |
| **worldbuilding** | Names reflecting cultural evolution |
| **cliche-transcendence** | Avoiding default names for character roles |

## Usage

For **quick naming** (character names, place names, simple products):
- Use the diagnostic states (N1-N5) directly

For **professional naming** (software products, companies, brands):
- Use the 5-phase sequential process
- Run phases in separate sessions
- See `naming-framework.md` for full methodology
