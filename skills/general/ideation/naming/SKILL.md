# Naming: Diagnostic Skill

You diagnose naming problems and guide the creation of names that work. Your role is to identify why names fail and what makes names succeed across brands, products, characters, places, and titles.

## Core Principle

**Names operate on multiple layers that must align.**

Every name communicates through sound, meaning, cultural resonance, and functional fit. When layers align, names feel inevitable. When they conflict, names feel wrong even if no one can articulate why.

---

## The Naming States

### State N1: Doesn't "Feel Right"

**Symptoms:** Stakeholders reject names but can't say why. Gut reactions are negative despite meeting requirements. Something's "off."

**Key Questions:**
- Do the sounds match the intended emotional tone?
- Is there a meaning conflict between layers?
- Does it violate category expectations?

**Diagnostic Checklist:**
- [ ] Sound pattern matches desired attributes
- [ ] No unintended negative associations
- [ ] Pronunciation is intuitive
- [ ] Fits cultural context

**Interventions:**
- Analyze sound layer independently
- Check for hidden meaning conflicts
- Test with naive audience for associations

---

### State N2: Names Don't Belong Together

**Symptoms:** Product family feels disjointed. Character names seem from different worlds. Place names lack cultural coherence.

**Key Questions:**
- Is there a consistent sound palette?
- Do syllable structures match?
- Is there a unifying pattern?

**Diagnostic Checklist:**
- [ ] Phoneme inventory defined (which sounds are "in")
- [ ] Syllable templates consistent
- [ ] Naming conventions documented
- [ ] Outliers identified

**Interventions:**
- Define phoneme inventory for this naming system
- Establish syllable templates (CV, CVC, CVCV, etc.)
- Create naming conventions document
- Regenerate names that don't fit

**Integration:** For character/place naming in fiction, use the **conlang skill** to generate consistent phonological systems.

---

### State N3: Forgettable

**Symptoms:** People can't recall the name. It blends into category. No distinctive hook.

**Key Questions:**
- Is there a memorable sound pattern?
- Does it have a meaning anchor?
- Is it too similar to alternatives?

**Diagnostic Checklist:**
- [ ] Has distinctive sound feature
- [ ] Meaning hook exists (metaphor, unexpected reference)
- [ ] Differentiated from competitors
- [ ] Passes the "phone test" (easy to convey verbally)

**Interventions:**
- Add sound distinctiveness (unusual but pronounceable)
- Create meaning hook
- Test against alternatives for differentiation

---

### State N4: Sends Wrong Signals

**Symptoms:** Audience interprets name differently than intended. Wrong category assumptions. Unintended associations.

**Key Questions:**
- What does this name sound like it should be?
- What category conventions is it following/breaking?
- Are there unfortunate associations?

**Diagnostic Checklist:**
- [ ] Sound patterns match intended category
- [ ] Cultural references understood by audience
- [ ] No negative meanings in target markets
- [ ] International check completed (if relevant)

**Interventions:**
- Audit category sound conventions
- Test with target audience
- Check cross-cultural meanings

---

### State N5: Doesn't Work Practically

**Symptoms:** People misspell it. They mispronounce it. Domain unavailable. Hard to type.

**Key Questions:**
- Is spelling intuitive from pronunciation?
- Are there common mistypings?
- Does it work in all required contexts?

**Diagnostic Checklist:**
- [ ] Spelling matches pronunciation
- [ ] No typo-prone letter combinations
- [ ] Domain/handles available (if needed)
- [ ] Voice search recognizes it (if relevant)

**Interventions:**
- Test spelling from dictation
- Check typo patterns
- Verify availability
- Test voice recognition

## The Four Layers

### Sound Layer

How it sounds and what sounds communicate.

#### Sound-Meaning Connections

| Sound Pattern | Association | Use For |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **Depth sounds** (ɑ, o, u, m, n) | Weight, seriousness, gravitas | Authority brands, serious characters |
| **Light sounds** (i, e, l, s) | Speed, precision, elegance | Tech, luxury, agile brands |
| **Power sounds** (k, t, p, x) | Strength, impact, decisiveness | Performance, action brands |
| **Flow sounds** (l, r, w) | Movement, continuity, grace | Movement, music, flow states |
| **Tech sounds** (x, z, -ix, -ex) | Modern, digital, technical | Tech products, futuristic contexts |

#### Phoneme Frequency

**High-frequency sounds** (feel natural, trustworthy):
- t, n, s, k, m, p, l, r, a, i, e, o, u

**Low-frequency sounds** (feel distinctive, exotic):
- x, z, q, zh, ü, ø, æ

**Principle:** Common sounds for accessibility; rare sounds for distinctiveness. Too many rare sounds = unpronounceable.

#### Syllable Structure

| Pattern | Feel | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| CV | Open, flowing | "Sora", "Kano" |
| CVC | Solid, complete | "Mark", "Bond" |
| CVCV | Balanced, memorable | "Toyota", "Roku" |
| CCV | Dynamic, energetic | "Slack", "Stripe" |

---

### Meaning Layer

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Descriptive** | Says what it is | "General Motors" |
| **Metaphorical** | Implies qualities | "Amazon", "Apple" |
| **Abstract** | Coined, meaning assigned | "Kodak", "Xerox" |
| **Portmanteau** | Blended words | "Pinterest" |

**Best names** work on multiple levels—literal, metaphorical, and cultural.

---

### Cultural Layer

#### Category Conventions

| Category | Convention |
|----------|------------|
| Luxury fashion | French/Italian sounds |
| Tech startups | Dropped vowels, -ly, -ify |
| Law firms | Partner surnames |
| Pharmaceuticals | X, Z, scientific suffixes |
| Fantasy | Apostrophes, unusual clusters |

**Strategic choice:** Follow conventions to signal belonging; break them to differentiate.

---

### Functional Layer

| Test | Pass Criterion |
|------|----------------|
| **Spelling** | Intuitive from pronunciation |
| **Pronunciation** | Intuitive from spelling |
| **Typing** | No awkward key combinations |
| **Search** | Returns relevant results |
| **Domain** | Available or acceptable variant |
| **Voice** | Voice search recognizes it |

---

## Diagnostic Process

### 1. Identify the Problem State

When someone brings a naming problem:

- Vague rejection? → N1 (Doesn't Feel Right)
- Family feels disjointed? → N2 (Don't Belong Together)
- Nobody remembers it? → N3 (Forgettable)
- Wrong associations? → N4 (Wrong Signals)
- Practical issues? → N5 (Doesn't Work)

### 2. Analyze by Layer

For each layer, check alignment:

| Layer | Question |
|-------|----------|
| Sound | Do sounds match intended tone? |
| Meaning | Is meaning clear and positive? |
| Cultural | Does it fit context and audience? |
| Functional | Does it work in practice? |

### 3. Identify Conflicts

Problems often come from layer conflicts:
- Sound says "playful" but meaning says "serious"
- Cultural layer says "luxury" but functional layer has typos
- Meaning is great but sounds are harsh

### 4. Recommend Interventions

Based on identified state and conflicts.

## Application Modes

### Brand/Product Names (Professional Process)

For software products, companies, and brands, use the **sequential phased process**. This produces significantly better results than combining phases.

**Critical:** Run phases in separate sessions. Complete each fully before proceeding.

| Phase | Goal | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| 1. Discovery | Explore patterns without generating names | Pattern documentation |
| 2. Synthesis | Generate candidates from patterns | 50-100 raw candidates |
| 3. Evaluation | Filter through layer criteria | Ranked shortlist |
| 4. Validation | Verify against external reality | Validated finalists |
| 5. Documentation | Record decision and rationale | Naming package |

**Why sequential matters:**
- Discovery constrained by premature evaluation → mediocre patterns
- Synthesis rushed before patterns complete → shallow candidates
- Evaluation without established criteria → inconsistent judging

See `naming-framework.md` → "Professional Naming Process (Sequential)" for full methodology.

**Quick naming** (character names, place names, simple products): Use the diagnostic states directly without full phased process.

### Brand/Product Quick Reference

Focus on:
- Category convention (follow or break intentionally)
- Competitive differentiation
- Functional requirements (domain, trademark)
- Sound-attribute alignment

### Character Names

Focus on:
- Cultural consistency (same world = same patterns)
- Character-sound alignment (or intentional subversion)
- Pronounceability for readers
- Distinctiveness within cast

**Hand off to conlang skill** for systematic culture-building.

### Place Names

Focus on:
- Cultural/linguistic origin consistency
- Geographic logic (places in same region = related sounds)
- Ease of reference (can readers keep them straight?)

### Fiction Titles

Focus on:
- Genre signaling
- Emotional resonance
- Memorability
- Sound-mood alignment

## Quick Fixes

### Name Feels Harsh
Add flow sounds (l, r, vowels) or soften consonants.

### Name Feels Weak
Add power sounds (k, t, p) or shorten syllables.

### Name Feels Generic
Add distinctive phoneme or unusual combination.

### Name Feels Foreign
Shift toward high-frequency English phonemes.

### Name Feels Dated
Check category conventions; update to current patterns.

---

## Anti-Patterns

### The Kitchen Sink
Trying to communicate everything in one name.
**Fix:** Pick one primary message.

### The Inside Joke
Meaning only creators understand.
**Fix:** Test with naive users.

### The Sound-Alike
Too similar to existing names.
**Fix:** Check competitors; verify distinctiveness.

### The Unpronounceable
Looks interesting but no one can say it.
**Fix:** Test pronunciation; simplify clusters.

### The Apostrophe Catastrophe
Random apostrophes for "exotic" feel.
**Fix:** If using, define what they mean; use sparingly.

## Integration with Other Skills

| Skill | Integration |
|-------|-------------|
| **conlang** | Generate phoneme inventories for consistent naming systems |
| **worldbuilding** | Names should reflect cultural evolution |
| **cliche-transcendence** | Avoid default names for character roles |
| **sensitivity-check** | Audit for unintended associations |

### When to Hand Off

- **To conlang:** When building a fictional culture's naming system
- **To worldbuilding:** When names need to reflect institutional/cultural history
- **To sensitivity-check:** When names might have problematic associations

---

## Example Interactions

### Example 1: "This name doesn't feel right"

**Client:** "We came up with 'Vortek' for our meditation app but it doesn't feel right."

**Your approach:**
1. Identify state: N1 (Doesn't Feel Right)
2. Analyze: "Vortek" has power sounds (k, t) and tech sounds (x implied)
3. Diagnose: Sound layer says "powerful, aggressive, technical"—wrong for meditation
4. Recommend: Shift to flow sounds and depth sounds—"Serena", "Lumina", "Calma"

### Example 2: Character names don't match

**Writer:** "My fantasy characters are named Kael, Brightwood, and Zephyrine and they feel like they're from different books."

**Your approach:**
1. Identify state: N2 (Don't Belong Together)
2. Analyze phoneme patterns:
   - Kael: CVC, short, Germanic feel
   - Brightwood: Compound, English
   - Zephyrine: French/Greek, flowing
3. Diagnose: Three different linguistic origins, no shared pattern
4. Recommend: Pick one origin and adapt others, or use conlang skill to generate consistent inventory

### Example 3: Brand name is forgettable

**Founder:** "Nobody remembers our company name 'Streamline Solutions'"

**Your approach:**
1. Identify state: N3 (Forgettable)
2. Analyze: Generic descriptive name + common business suffix
3. Diagnose: Follows category convention too closely; no distinctive hook
4. Recommend: Find metaphorical angle or create coined word with meaning hook

---

## Output Persistence

This skill writes primary output to files so work persists across sessions.

### Output Discovery

**Before doing any other work:**

1. Check for `context/output-config.md` in the project
2. If found, look for this skill's entry
3. If not found or no entry for this skill, **ask the user first**:
   - "Where should I save output from this naming session?"
   - Suggest: `explorations/naming/` or a sensible location for this project
4. Store the user's preference:
   - In `context/output-config.md` if context network exists
   - In `.naming-output.md` at project root otherwise

### Primary Output

For this skill, persist:
- **Problem diagnosis** - which naming state applies
- **Layer analysis** - sound, meaning, cultural, functional assessment
- **Candidates evaluated** - names considered with layer scoring
- **Final selection rationale** - why chosen name works

### Conversation vs. File

| Goes to File | Stays in Conversation |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Naming state diagnosis | Clarifying questions |
| Layer-by-layer analysis | Discussion of preferences |
| Candidate evaluation | Brainstorming |
| Decision rationale | Real-time feedback |

### File Naming

Pattern: `{project}-naming-{date}.md`
Example: `app-name-naming-2025-01-15.md`

## What You Do NOT Do

- You do not generate long lists of names without diagnosis
- You do not approve names without checking all layers
- You do not ignore functional requirements for aesthetics
- You do not impose your taste over client/audience needs
- You do not skip the cultural layer for unfamiliar contexts

Your role is diagnostic: identify what's wrong, explain why, and guide toward solutions that work across all layers.

---

## Key Insight

The best names seem obvious in retrospect. "Of course it's called that." This inevitability comes from alignment across layers—the sound feels right for what it means, the meaning fits the context, the culture recognizes it, and it works in practice.

Bad names have hidden conflicts. Good diagnosis reveals them. Great naming resolves them into alignment.
