# Research Methodology

Detailed background on the research methodology used in this workflow.

## Why Structured Research?

Unstructured research often leads to:
- Incomplete coverage of the topic
- Confirmation bias (finding what you expect)
- Poor source evaluation
- Unfocused or rambling outputs

Structured research addresses these issues through systematic phases.

## The Four-Phase Model

### Phase 1: Planning

**Purpose**: Define scope and strategy before searching

**Key Activities**:
- Transform vague topics into specific questions
- Identify knowledge gaps to fill
- Plan query sequence from broad to specific
- Set success criteria

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- Skipping directly to searching
- Asking only one question
- Not planning for verification queries

### Phase 2: Execution

**Purpose**: Gather information systematically

**Key Activities**:
- Execute queries in planned order
- Document findings immediately
- Evaluate source credibility
- Identify emerging questions

**Search Strategy Patterns**:

1. **Funnel Pattern**: Start broad, narrow down
   - Overview → Specifics → Details

2. **Multi-perspective Pattern**: Cover different viewpoints
   - Proponents → Critics → Neutral analysis

3. **Temporal Pattern**: Track evolution
   - Historical → Current → Future trends

4. **Geographic Pattern**: Consider different contexts
   - Global → Regional → Local

### Phase 3: Analysis

**Purpose**: Make sense of gathered information

**Key Activities**:
- Categorize findings by theme
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Assess evidence strength
- Note gaps and conflicts

**Analysis Frameworks**:

1. **SWOT for Topics**:
   - Strengths/Benefits
   - Weaknesses/Challenges
   - Opportunities/Trends
   - Threats/Risks

2. **5 Whys for Understanding**:
   - Keep asking "why" to get to root causes

3. **Compare/Contrast for Options**:
   - Side-by-side evaluation of alternatives

### Phase 4: Synthesis

**Purpose**: Create useful, coherent output

**Key Activities**:
- Select appropriate output format
- Structure information logically
- Write clear, actionable content
- Include proper attribution

**Synthesis Principles**:
- Lead with conclusions
- Support with evidence
- Acknowledge uncertainty
- Enable action

## Source Evaluation Framework

### Primary vs. Secondary Sources

**Primary Sources** (prefer these):
- Original research papers
- Official documentation
- First-hand accounts
- Direct data

**Secondary Sources** (use carefully):
- News articles
- Blog posts
- Aggregated analyses
- Textbooks

### Credibility Assessment

**CRAAP Test**:
- **Currency**: Is it recent enough?
- **Relevance**: Does it address your question?
- **Authority**: Is the source qualified?
- **Accuracy**: Is it supported by evidence?
- **Purpose**: What's the source's motivation?

### Bias Detection

Look for:
- Funding sources
- Organizational affiliations
- Commercial interests
- Political leanings
- Omission of counterarguments

## Confidence Levels

### High Confidence
- Multiple authoritative sources agree
- Evidence is verifiable
- Claims are specific and falsifiable
- Recent and well-cited

### Medium Confidence
- Some evidence exists
- Limited number of sources
- Evidence is indirect
- Some conflicting information

### Low Confidence
- Single source only
- Evidence is anecdotal
- Significant conflicts exist
- Information is dated

## Adapting to Research Types

### Factual Research
Focus on: Accuracy, recency, authoritative sources
Example: "What is the population of Tokyo?"

### Exploratory Research
Focus on: Breadth, multiple perspectives, emerging patterns
Example: "What are the impacts of remote work?"

### Comparative Research
Focus on: Consistent criteria, fair representation, trade-offs
Example: "React vs Vue for new projects?"

### Decision Support Research
Focus on: Actionability, risk assessment, recommendations
Example: "Should we migrate to microservices?"

## Time Management

### Quick Research (15-30 min)
- 1-2 focused questions
- 3-5 queries
- Brief synthesis
- Key takeaways only

### Standard Research (1-2 hours)
- 3-5 questions
- 10-15 queries
- Full analysis
- Structured report

### Deep Research (4+ hours)
- Comprehensive question set
- 20+ queries
- Detailed analysis
- Extensive documentation

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Premature Synthesis**: Drawing conclusions too early
2. **Source Homogeneity**: Using only similar sources
3. **Recency Bias**: Ignoring historical context
4. **Complexity Avoidance**: Oversimplifying nuanced topics
5. **Confirmation Seeking**: Only finding supporting evidence
