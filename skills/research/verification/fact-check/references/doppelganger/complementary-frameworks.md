Implementation patterns:
- Imagine a future where the plan has failed
- Work backward to identify likely failure modes
- Differentiate between preventable and unpreventable risks
- Structure environmental design to mitigate identified risks

When to apply:
- Before committing significant resources to a plan
- When optimism bias might cloud judgment

- When working with novel approaches that lack established patterns

## Enhanced Systems Analysis

### Cynefin Framework
- Categorization system for problem domains based on relationship between cause and effect
- Guides selection of appropriate decision-making approaches for different contexts

Domain characteristics:
- **Clear**: Established best practices exist; "Sense-Categorize-Respond"
- **Complicated**: Analysis by experts required; "Sense-Analyze-Respond"
- **Complex**: Emergent patterns; experimentation needed; "Probe-Sense-Respond"
- **Chaotic**: No clear cause-effect; stabilization required; "Act-Sense-Respond"
- **Disorder**: Domain unclear; identify domain first

Application to existing framework:
- Informs when to apply binary vs. complex implementation approaches
- Provides structure for balancing adaptability vs. routine
- Guides appropriate evidence standards for different contexts
- Particularly valuable for ADHD management through appropriate cognitive allocation

### Leverage Points in Systems
- Hierarchy of intervention points for maximum system impact
- Extension of systems thinking with practical focus on effective change

Points in order of increasing effectiveness:
1. Numbers (parameters, constants)
2. Buffers (sizes of stabilizing stocks)
3. Stock-and-flow structures
4. Delays (time duration between system events)
5. Balancing feedback loops
6. Reinforcing feedback loops
7. Information flows
8. Rules (incentives, punishments, constraints)
9. Self-organization
10. Goals
11. Paradigms

- **Opportunity costs**: Considering invisible trade-offs in any decision
- **Circle of competence**: Understanding boundaries of reliable knowledge
- **Network effects**: Recognizing value that scales with user/node count
- **Feedback loops**: Identifying reinforcing and balancing cycles

- **Good decision, bad outcome**: Proper process with bad luck
- **Bad decision, good outcome**: Improper process with good luck
- **Bad decision, bad outcome**: Improper process with expected negative result

Application to truth hierarchies:
- Distinguishes between process truth and outcome truth
- Prevents reinforcement of bad processes that yield temporary positive outcomes
- Creates feedback loops for improving decision quality independent of randomness
- Maintains intellectual honesty while acknowledging reality of outcomes

### Satisficing vs. Maximizing
- Formalized approach to "done over perfect" value tension
- Provides structured criteria for when "good enough" is optimal

Implementation framework:
- Establish minimum acceptable criteria before beginning
- Set clear stopping conditions that trigger completion
- Differentiate between contexts requiring "good enough" vs. "best possible"
- Create decision rules for when to satisfice vs. maximize

Benefits for ADHD/autism management:
- Reduces decision fatigue through clear stopping points
- Prevents perfectionism loops by establishing predefined adequacy
- Lowers cognitive load by limiting option evaluation
- Increases completion rate by formalizing "good enough"

## Critical Thinking Extensions

5. Evaluate improved argument against your position

Integration benefits:

Process components:
- **Observe**: Gather unfiltered information
- **Orient**: Update mental models based on observations
- **Decide**: Determine course of action
- **Act**: Implement decision
- Return to observation with new context

Application value:
- Emphasizes orientation (mental model updating) as critical step
- Provides lightweight structure for implementing adaptability
- Creates deliberate decision points for system assessment
- Complements "breadth over immediate depth" with efficient exploration mechanism

### Second-Order Thinking
- Formalized approach to evaluating indirect consequences
- Extension of systems thinking with specific focus on cascading effects

Implementation structure:
- First-order question: "What happens next?"
- Second-order question: "What happens after that?"
- Consider:
  - Feedback loops triggered by initial effects
  - Incentive changes for other actors in the system
  - Potential adaptations by system participants
  - Emergent properties from multiple simultaneous changes

Integration with existing framework:
- Enhances systems thinking with structured consequence mapping
- Provides implementation approach for tension between short and long-term focus
- Supports identification of unintended consequences
- Creates checkpoints for system-level awareness in decision processes

## Strategic Context Mapping

### Wardley Mapping

## Application Integration Process

When incorporating these complementary frameworks:

1. **Identify Relevant Framework**
   - Determine which framework best applies to current context
   - Consider whether multiple frameworks should be combined

2. **Map to Existing System**
   - Connect to most relevant existing framework element
   - Determine how the complementary approach extends current understanding

3. **Implementation Adaptation**
   - Modify implementation patterns to account for ADHD/autism requirements
   - Adjust cognitive load based on current capacity

4. **Evaluation Cycle**
   - Test effectiveness of framework application
   - Document patterns of successful integration
   - Identify triggers for when specific frameworks provide highest value

The goal isn't comprehensive application of all frameworks, but selective integration of elements that provide highest leverage for current challenges while maintaining system coherence.
